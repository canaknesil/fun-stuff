(From within rescue mode)

Command: ls

It will list all your drives and partitions, like:

(hd0) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1)

If you don't know your Ubuntu boot partition, check them one by one:

ls (hd0,msdos2)/

ls (hd0,msdos1)/

When you hit the right one, you'll get a line mentioning "lost+found" an so on.

Assuming (hd0,msdos2) is the right partition:

set prefix=(hd0,2)/boot/grub

set root=(hd0,2)

insmod normal

normal

Now you'll be able to boot into Ubuntu. Once you do, execute the following commands:

sudo update-grub

sudo grub-install /dev/sda

Voila.
